	<p>
		A comparison of various charting frameworks. Currently
		they're just asked to render 100,000 data points as a line
		chart.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="d3/">D3</a> - Popular, successful OSS, well designed, svg-based.</li>
		<li><a href="highcharts/">Highcharts</a> - Popular, feature-rich, not free, svg-based.</li>
		<li><a href="dygraphs/">Dygraphs</a> - Canvas-based, over 5 years old, code is soupy but well tested.</li>
		<li><a href="rickshaw/">Rickshaw</a> - Based on D3, just a sugary layer on top?</li>
		<li><a href="custom/">Custom Canvas</a> - Just testing out the most raw format</li>
		<li><a href="chartjs/">Chart.js</a> - New, canvas-based, horrible architecture (example: every datapoint needs a visible label). It dies with 100k data points, so it's currently drawing 1k.</li>
